summary: A flexible package manager that supports multiple configurations.
description: |
  Spack is a multi-platform package manager that builds and installs multiple
   versions and configurations of software. It works on Linux, macOS, and many
   supercomputers. Spack is non-destructive: installing a new version of a
   package does not break existing installations, so many configurations of the
   same package can coexist.

  Spack offers a simple "spec" syntax that allows users to specify versions and
   configuration options. Package files are written in pure Python, and specs
   allow package authors to write a single script for many different builds of
   the same package. With Spack, you can build your software all the ways you
   want to.
